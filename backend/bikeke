ECOWAS Summit 2026 Declaration
==============================


I. Energy & Infrastructure
--------------------------

Dear [Recipient's Name],

Thank you for your invitation to participate in the ECOWAS Summit 2026. As a member of the Energy and Infrastructure Technical Working Group (TWG), my team and I have identified several key priorities that we believe will be essential for achieving our goals and advancing the energy sector in West Africa.

1. **Regional Power Pool Expansion and Optimization**: We propose to deepen and optimize regional power pools across the ECOWAS region, which would facilitate greater connectivity and distribution of renewable energy (renewable) energy sources. This initiative aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of existing power networks while promoting sustainable energy access for all regions within the bloc.

2. **Renewable Energy Targets (Solar, Wind, Hydropower)**: We plan to establish clear and ambitious targets for the growth of renewable energy in West Africa. These goals will guide policy decisions at the national level and contribute to the decarbonization of the region, thereby fostering a sustainable future for our shared continent.

3. **Energy Access Programs (Rural Electrification) and Investment Mobilization**: We are committed to implementing targeted programs that focus on improving access to electricity in remote and underserved areas. This includes developing rural electrification initiatives and exploring innovative financing mechanisms to ensure that these projects reach the most vulnerable communities. By aligning our efforts with the Abuja Declaration's commitments, we aim to contribute to the overall energy sector development in West Africa.

4. **Policy Harmonization and Implementation**: We will work closely with the ECOWAS member states to harmonize their policies and regulations, ensuring consistency across all regions within the bloc. This collaborative approach will facilitate smoother integration of renewable energy into regional power grids and enhance the efficiency of our energy supply systems.

5. **Resource Mobilization and Infrastructure Development**: To achieve these objectives, we plan to mobilize resources through various channels such as financial assistance, grants, and partnerships with international organizations. Our goal is to ensure that necessary funds are channelled towards the implementation of our projects, thereby ensuring that they meet the needs of all stakeholders involved.

In conclusion, this declaration represents a comprehensive roadmap for enhancing regional power interconnections and renewable energy deployment in West Africa. We look forward to working together with the ECOWAS member states, local partners, and other stakeholders to realize these commitments and contribute to the development of our region through sustainable energy solutions.

Thank you again for your consideration. Please let us know if there are any adjustments needed before proceeding further.
